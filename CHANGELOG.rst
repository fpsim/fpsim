Version 2.0.2 (2025-05-28)
---------------------------
Introduces a flexible location_registry system to support custom location modules defined outside the core fpsim package.
External users can now create an analysis repo and register their own locations in their respective repo via fpsim.defaults.register_location(),
eliminating the need for a user to modify the core code in order to test creating their own model in location other than Ethiopia, Senegal, or Kenya.

Version 2.0.1 (2025-05-09)
---------------------------
- Cleanup of data processing scripts in the data_processing directory
- Creation of shared_data dir for data shared across model locations and corresponding data_utils cleanup
- Addition of <location>.py template for new users
- Documentation overhaul in locations/README, data_processing/README, and data processing scripts

Version 2.0.0 (2025-03-31)
---------------------------
FPsim 2.0 represents a major overhaul of how the model represents contraceptive choices. Previously, women updated their contraceptive choices each year in their birth month.
This version introduces a new method for setting contraceptive choices, whereby women choose a method of contraception, and are then assigned a duration of use (`dur_use`). They update their contraceptive choice at the end of this duration, or after certain other events (e.g. postpartum, or after a change in one of their empowerment metrics).

To support this new feature, this PR also introduces several new items:
 - `ContraceptiveChoice` modules can be defined (eg, `SimpleChoice`) and flexibly added to sims depending on how one wishes to model the mechanism for choosing contraception

 There are also several other minor changes:
 - `sim.i` has been renamed `sim.ti` for consistency across starsim modules and for clarity that it refers to an integer representation of time (time step)
 - `track_switching` has been moved to an analyzer
 - the fpsim `ndict` class has been removed and replaced with the starsim `ndict` class
 - the lists of lists in the results object have been replaced with arrays
 - `Education` modules have been added
 - new parameters and people's attributes have been added: `fertility_intent`, `intent_to_use` and `wealth_quintile`
 - new analyzer "Life of" has been added to visualise the events during the lifecourse of a woman
 - new intervention that allows for changes in the probability of initiation (of contraceptive use) in contraception modules that use a logistic regression module.
 - Fixes a bug that prevented simulations from running if pars['timestep'] !=1
 - Adds a circular buffer to track the last 12 months of data, and enable model updates that depend on the previous state

- *GitHub info*: PR `163 <https://github.com/amath-idm/fp_analyses/pull/163>`__


Version 0.7.2 (2021-07-14)
--------------------------
- Allow ``total_trials`` to be passed to an ``fp.Calibration`` object.
- *GitHub info*: PR `162 <https://github.com/amath-idm/fp_analyses/pull/162>`__


Version 0.7.1 (2021-07-14)
--------------------------
- Allow ``weights`` to be passed to an ``fp.Calibration`` object.
- *GitHub info*: PR `161 <https://github.com/amath-idm/fp_analyses/pull/161>`__


Version 0.7.0 (2021-06-29)
--------------------------
- Added new calibration plotting methods.
- Separated Experiment and Calibration into separate files, and renamed ``model.py`` to ``sim.py``.
- Fixed a bug where the age pyramid was being unintentionally modified in-place.
- *GitHub info*: PR `144 <https://github.com/amath-idm/fp_analyses/pull/144>`__


Version 0.6.5 (2021-06-11)
--------------------------
- Added R support; see ``examples/example_sim.R``.
- Fixed a bug where the age pyramid was being unintentionally modified in-place.
- *GitHub info*: PR `128 <https://github.com/amath-idm/fp_analyses/pull/128>`__


Version 0.6.4 (2021-06-10)
--------------------------
- Added a ``MultiSim`` class, which can handle parallel runs and uncertainty bounds.
- *GitHub info*: PR `124 <https://github.com/amath-idm/fp_analyses/pull/124>`__


Version 0.6.3 (2021-06-10)
--------------------------
- Fixed a bug where exposure correction by age was accidentally being clipped to the range [0,1], restoring behavior of the array-based model to match the object-based model (notwithstanding stochastic effects and other bugfixes).
- *GitHub info*: PR `119 <https://github.com/amath-idm/fp_analyses/pull/119>`__


Version 0.6.2 (2021-05-10)
--------------------------
- Added ``fp.Intervention`` and ``fp.Analyzer`` classes, which are much more flexible ways to modify and record the state of the simulation, respectively.
- Fixed a bug with only females being born.
- *GitHub info*: PR `100 <https://github.com/amath-idm/fp_analyses/pull/100>`__


Version 0.6.1 (2021-05-02)
--------------------------
- Renamed ``fp.Calibration`` to ``fp.Experiment``, and added a new ``fp.Calibration`` class, using Optuna.
- This allows the user to do e.g. ``calib = fp.Calibration(pars); calib.calibrate(calib_pars)``
- Calibrating a single parameter takes about 20 seconds for a single parameter and a small population size (500 people). Realistic calibrations should take roughly 10 - 60 minutes.
- *GitHub info*: PR `93 <https://github.com/amath-idm/fp_analyses/pull/93>`__


Version 0.6.0 (2021-05-01)
--------------------------
- Refactored the model to use an array-based implementation, instead of a loop over individual people.
- This results in a performance increase of roughly 20-100x, depending on the size of the simulation. In practice, this means that 50,000 people can be run in roughly the same amount of time as 500 could be previously.
- *GitHub info*: PR `92 <https://github.com/amath-idm/fp_analyses/pull/92>`__


Version 0.5.2 (2021-04-30)
--------------------------
- Added a new script, ``preprocess_data.py``, that takes large raw data files and preprocesses them down to only the essentials used in the model.
- This increases the performance of ``calib.run()`` (**not** counting model runtime) by a factor of 1000.
- *GitHub info*: PR `91 <https://github.com/amath-idm/fp_analyses/pull/91>`__


Version 0.5.1 (2021-04-29)
--------------------------
- Added ``summarize()`` and ``to_json()`` methods to ``Calibration``. Also added an ``fp.diff_summaries()`` method for comparing them.
- Added regression and benchmarking tests (current total time: 24 s).
- Added a code coverage script (current code coverage: 59%).
- Added default flags for which quantities to compute.
- Split the logic of ``Calibration`` out into more detail: e.g., initialization, running, and post-processing.
- *GitHub info*: PR `90 <https://github.com/amath-idm/fp_analyses/pull/90>`__
