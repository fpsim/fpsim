- *GitHub info*: PR `124 <https://github.com/amath-idm/fp_analyses/pull/124>`__


Version 0.6.3 (2021-06-10)

- *GitHub info*: PR `91 <https://github.com/amath-idm/fp_analyses/pull/91>`__


Version 0.5.1 (2021-04-29)

- Added default flags for which quantities to compute.
- Split the logic of ``Calibration`` out into more detail: e.g., initialization, running, and post-processing.
