# Setting up PyPI publishing

In addition to running CI/CD tests, FPsim versions can also be released on PyPI via a GitHub Action. This is controlled by `pypi_release.yml`.

To set up the integration, see [this article](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/publishing-package-distribution-releases-using-github-actions-ci-cd-workflows/).

In short, the steps are:
1. Log into the owner's PyPI account
2. Go to https://pypi.org/manage/project/fpsim/settings/publishing
3. Fill in the form (in this case: `fpsim`, `fpsim`, `fpsim`, `pypi_release.yml`, `pypi`)
4. Click "Add"

That's it! This shouldn't need to be done again, unless the owner or workflow name changes.
