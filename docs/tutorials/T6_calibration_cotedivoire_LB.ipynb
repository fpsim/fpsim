    "# Model Calibration\n",
    "## Why calibrate?\n",
    "Calibration is the process of fine-tuning an agent-based model's input parameters so that its simulated outputs align with real-world data. Without calibration, the model might generate plausible-looking behavior that doesn’t actually reflect reality. Calibration improves the model’s credibility, predictive power, and policy relevance by ensuring it reproduces key observed patterns or outcomes from historical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Calibration Process Overview\n",
    "1. Define Calibration Targets:\n",
    "Select measurable real-world data points (e.g., population size, disease prevalence, contraceptive use) that the model should replicate.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Identify Parameters to Tune:\n",
    "Choose uncertain model parameters that strongly influence the outcomes but lack precise empirical estimates (e.g., agent behavior probabilities, environmental factors, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Choose a Calibration Method:\n",
    "Use either:\n",
    "- Manual/heuristic tuning (trial-and-error or expert knowledge), or\n",
    "- Automated optimization (e.g., grid search, random search, genetic algorithms, or Bayesian methods) to systematically explore parameter space.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Define a Goodness-of-Fit Metric:\n",
    "Quantify how well the model output matches the targets using metrics like root mean squared error (RMSE), likelihood scores, or custom error functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Run the Calibration:\n",
    "Simulate the model repeatedly with different parameter values and evaluate performance using the fit metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Select Best-Fit Parameters:\n",
    "Identify parameter sets that produce model outputs closest to observed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Validate (if possible):\n",
    "Use separate data not involved in calibration to assess the model’s generalizability.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will walk through the basics of running both a manual and automated calibration. Choosing between manual and automated calibration depends on the model complexity, parameter uncertainty, available data, and computational resources. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Manual Calibration\n",
    "Manual calibration involves adjusting parameters by hand based on expert knowledge or visual inspection of outputs. This can make sense when:\n",
    "- The model has few parameters to tune\n",
    "- You have strong domain knowledge about parameter ranges\n",
    "- You are in the early stages of model development or prototyping\n",
    "- The simulation is computationally expensive or you have limited computational resources\n",
    "- You want to explore model behavior qualitatively\n",
    "\n",
    "The plotting class (in plotting.py) can be used to visually inspect the outputs of common target parameters (e.g. CPR, method mix, TFR, etc.) and compare the model output vs real-world data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Automated Calibration\n",
    "Automated calibration uses optimization algorithms (like Optuna’s Bayesian optimization) to efficiently search parameter space for the best fit. An automated calibration in FPsim uses the calibration and experiment classes to use Optuna's optimization methods to determine the best free parameters. This makes sense to use when:\n",
    "- Your model has many uncertain parameters (e.g. 5+)\n",
    "- You have access to compute resources to run many simulations (e.g. in parallel on a machine or VM with ample processing power, memory, and storage OR on a cloud computing platform)\n",
    "- You have a large number of target parameters to which you want to calibrate with an unbiased approach\n",
    " \n",
    "A hybrid approach can also be to start with a manual calibration to narrow down plausible ranges and understand model dynamics. Then switch to automated methods to fine-tune parameters and formalize the process. "

The good news is that we already learned how to adjust the birth space bins by modifying the spacing_pref param; thus, we can keep the free parameters we've adjusted so far and decrease the spacing_pref 12-24mo weight again to continue the calibration. \n",

It is not used to guide the optimization algorithm directly but serves as a baseline for comparison to assess how much the calibration improves model fit. The 'low' and 'high' values define the range of plausible values that Optuna will explore during calibration.

    "Deciding when a calibration is sufficient is part science, part judgment. While there is no universal threshold, you can use a combination of quantitative indicators and practical considerations to determine sufficiency. A key metric to monitor is the mismatch — the numerical value representing the error between model output and observed data. Calibration is generally considered sufficient when the best mismatch has stabilized over a series of trials, indicating that further optimization yields diminishing returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can visualize this trend using plot_trend(), which shows how the mismatch improves over time. A flattening curve suggests that the optimizer has converged. Additionally, plot_best() helps examine the distribution of parameters from the best-performing trials. A concentrated cluster of low-mismatch solutions is a good sign of a stable and well-behaved calibration.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s also important to assess parameter realism. Calibrated values should fall well within plausible ranges and not sit at the bounds of their allowed values — this may indicate a need to expand parameter ranges or run more trials. The quality of fit across all outputs should be visually and statistically evaluated using post-calibration plots. A good calibration improves fit across multiple targets without overfitting any single metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, reproducibility is key: rerunning the calibration should produce similar results. If the results vary significantly between runs/with different seeds, consider increasing the number of trials or reviewing your parameter bounds. Calibration is complete not just when the mismatch is low, but when the parameter values are stable, plausible, and generate outputs that align well with observed data.\n",
