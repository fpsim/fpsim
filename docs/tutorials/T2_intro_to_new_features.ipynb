    "\n",
    "There are many factors that influence women's decisions about contraceptive use. FPsim 2.0 brings enhancements that incorporate these factors. It also provides users with new flexibility for defining their own logic for how women make contraceptive decisions. We will illustrate some of this functionality in this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, some terminology. All of the logic for how women make contraception decisions is kept within a `ContraceptiveChoice` module. The default `ContraceptiveChoice` module within FPsim is `StandardChoice`. There is also a more detailed `EmpoweredChoice` module in an [analysis repository](https://github.com/fpsim/kenya_empowerment)."

    "In the `SimpleChoice` module, a woman's decision about whether to use contraception only depends on her age and whether or not she has ever used contraception before.

    "The `RandomChoice` module is included only for testing purposes. In this module, women choose contraception at random. This module can be useful for sanity checking that the more realistic modules behave as expected.\n",

    "It is recommended that use of the `SimpleChoice` and `RandomChoice` modules is reserved for testing purposes, as the `StandardChoice` captures more of the factors relevant for contraceptive decision making. Nevertheless, the example below shows how to use the `SimpleChoice` module. This example can also be considered as a template for anyone wishing to define their own contraceptive choice module."
