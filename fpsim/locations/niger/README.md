# Data

The fpsim/locations/data folder stores the location-specific files for FPsim models generated by the data_processing/DHS_PMA_scripts/*R and data_processing/UN_WB_data_scraping/*.py scripts. Below is a description of manual edits that were applied for missing data sources. If the file is not mentioned below, no manual edits were applied.
