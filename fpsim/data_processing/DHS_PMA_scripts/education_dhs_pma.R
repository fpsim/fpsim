# -- Extract education data from DHS and PMA data datasets
# From DHS (https://dhsprogram.com/) we use the IR (Individual Recode) to extract:
# - education objective (expressed in percentage of women that will aim to
#                        complete X years of education, sratified by type of
#                        residential setting).
# - education initialization (expressed in (edu) number of years a woman aged (age)
#                             will have likely completed).
#
# From PMA (https://datalab.pmadata.org/) we use all phases of the most recent year of data to extract:
# - education stopping criteria (expressed in percentage of women aged (age)
#                                years old and a given parity that would dropout
#                                from their education if they got pregnant.
#
# Creates: edu_initialization.csv, edu_objective.csv, edu_stop.csv
