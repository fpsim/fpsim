'''
A sample script that uses the Calibration class to generate the optimal set of free parameters, runs a sim with that set
of free params, and then generates plots showing the discrepancies between the model vs data.

Note: running a calibration does not guarantee a good fit! You must ensure that
you run for a sufficient number of iterations, have enough free parameters, and
that the parameters have wide enough bounds. To modify calibration settings and see
further documentation, see calibration.py. By default, the target parameters that
the calibration classes uses are listed in the default_flags in experiment.py (which
is used by the calibration class to determine goodness of fit).

PRIOR TO RUNNING:
1. Be sure to set the plotting config variables in the first section below (country, figs directory, save option) as well as
any sim parameters and free params (for calibration) in the 'run_sim' function

2. Ensure that fpsim/locations contains both a directory for the country being calibrated, and ensure this location directory
 contains a corresponding location file (i.e. 'ethiopia.py') and 'data/' subdirectory

3. In order to run this script, the country data must be stored in the country directory mentioned above and with the
following naming conventions:

ageparity.csv' # Age-parity distribution file
use.csv' # Dichotomous contraceptive method use
birth_spacing_dhs.csv'  # Birth-to-birth interval data
afb.table.csv'  # Ages at first birth in DHS for women age 25-50
cpr.csv'  # Contraceptive prevalence rate data; from UN Data Portal
asfr.csv'  # Age-specific data fertility rate data
mix.csv'  # Contraceptive method mix
tfr.csv'  # Total fertility rate data
popsize.csv'  # Population by year

4. Ensure that the data in the aforementioned files are formatted properly (see files in locations/kenya/data for reference)

5. Verify desired settings in calibration.py (i.e. number of trials)
